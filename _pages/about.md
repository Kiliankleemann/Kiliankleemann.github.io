Welcome to my online portfolio, where i aggregate works, projects and share thought and comments. I'm currently doing my PhD in bioinformatics at Bonn University and focus on transposable elements in Alzheimer Disease. 

I am enthusiastic about microglia and their role in Alzheimer Disease 🧠. My bioinformatic work focuses on high-dimensional data analysis including bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, as well as ChIP and ATAC sequencing 🧬. 

My reserach career so far started with my bachelor in Glasgow 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 - during which I did research internships at the German Center for Neurodegeneration (DZNE) 🇩🇪 and in Glasgow. I then went on to do research in bioinformatics in Boston 🇺🇸 and also did my master in data analytics. During my PhD in Bonn so far I have also established research cooperation with Tongji University in Shanghai 🇨🇳 and conducted a 3 month research exchange in autum of 2024. Check out more highlights in my [blog page](/kilian-kleemann.info/blog/) and my [projects](/kilian-kleemann.info/projects/) about my differnet research experiences across the globe. 🌏

Check out my [publications page](/kilian-kleemann.info/publications/) record where I also showcase the analysis I have done.
