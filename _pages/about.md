Welcome to my online portfolio and website, where i aggregate works, projects and share thought and comments. I'm currently doing my PhD in bioinformatics at Bonn University and focus on transposable elements in Alzheimer Disease. 

I am enthusiastic about microglia and their role in Alzheimer Disease. My bioinformatic work focuses on high-dimensional data analysis including bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, as well as ChIP and ATAC sequencing. 

Check out my [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) record where I also showcase the analysis I have done automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
